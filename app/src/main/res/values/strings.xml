    <string name="intro_intro_text1">
        This app is designed to lower your stress levels and improve your emotional wellbeing,
        by carrying out three simple daily tasks. Research into neuroscience and psychology has
        shown that these tasks will make you happier, healthier and more resilient:
    </string>
    <string name="intro_intro_text2">
        •	A Good Nights Sleep
        \n•	Positive Thinking
        \n•	Kindness
    </string>
    <string name="intro_intro_text3">
        The tools on this app are designed to make these tasks as easy as possible, and help you
        remember to do them daily.  Like anything new, we need to repeat the activity daily in
        order to build the neural pathways in our brain for the benefit to be felt, and the new
        habits to form.
    </string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_title">A Good Nights Sleep</string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_text1">
        Sleep is when we physically and emotionally recuperate, it is fundamental to how well we
        cope with the challenges of the day. A good nights sleep improves concentration, focus,
        physical performance, social interactions, and even boosts your immune system! The track
        is designed to allow your body and mind relax into a good nights sleep.
    </string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_text2">
        Also, using a Solution Focused Hypnotherapy track as you fall asleep makes use of the
        important neurological state that occurs between waking and sleeping.  At this point your
        subconscious mind listens to the positive suggestions of the therapist (even if you’re not
        listening!) and your mind can start working on creative ways to improve things for you
        while you dream that night.
    </string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_text3">
        Other things to promote good sleep
    </string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_text4">
        •	Keep to the same routine at night (the same waking and sleeping times, and creating a
        bedtime “ritual” eg bathroom, read, listen to the track)
        \n•	Limiting your exposure to light in the hour before you sleep (this includes not
        watching screens)
        \n•	Keep your bedroom cool
        \n•	Exercise daily
        \n•	Avoid caffeine and nicotine after lunch, and avoid alcohol before bed.
    </string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_text5">
        How to use the track
    </string>
    <string name="intro_sleep_text6">
        Play this track every night as you go to sleep - play it again if you are still awake
        at the end.  If you wake in the night, pop it back on again!
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_title">Your Good Things Diary</string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text1">
        Writing down towards the end of the day good things that have happened to you promotes
        calmness and lowers stress levels according to recent research.
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text2">
        When life is too difficult, for too long, we can get into a habit of thinking negatively
        about ourselves or our lives.  This is unhelpful as it can lead to the emotional and
        physical responses of anxiety, depression, or anger.  You can change the habitual way
        you think, and therefore how you feel by doing this simply task daily.  By spending time
        reflecting on what’s good in your life, you will change your perspective on the world -
        shifting your focus to what really matters in life.
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text3">
        You will also end up with an uplifting diary that you can re-read on those blue days!
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text4">
        How to use the diary
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text5">
        Set the daily reminder (it’s best in the evening or just before bed).  Write your 5 good
        things from that day in the diary (3 is easy - 5 will give your brain a good workout!).
        Try to write different ones each day.  This is your diary, there’s no limit to what you
        can include. Here’s some ideas of what you could write about:
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text6">
        •	Experiences you’ve enjoyed “Went for a dog walk with my friend Jen”
        \n•	Things you’ve seen around you “it was a beautiful Spring day today, sunny and fresh”
        \n•	Someone who made you smile “Steve made me laugh dancing along to the radio this morning!”
        \n•	Something went well “my report went down well at today\'s meeting”
        \n•	Something you’ve achieved “managed to play my new piece of sax music today - been
        trying to get it right all week!”
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text7">
        Dealing with a stressful or low day
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text8">
        What’s been good can be a hard thing to do on these days, but it’s really important. You
        are reminding your brain that your intention is to focus on the positives.  You have a
        few choices:
    </string>
    <string name="intro_positivity_text9">
        •	Write about the ‘big’ things “my children are all well”
        \n•	Think about how well you’ve coped “stressful day at work, but I managed to keep my
        cool all day” “I got out of bed today”
        \n•	Notice the small things “my daffodils are appearing”
